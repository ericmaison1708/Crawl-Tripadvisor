      "text": "Visited hotel 1926 for our anniversary weekend. On arrival the hotel appeared tucked away however the view fromOur room 919 was beautiful. This hotel has every modernity I had never even contemplated - digital door pads, tablet in room for extra requests and information. The bathroom is massive although be warned a towel on the floor after showering is a must! I had both a eyebrow treatment and my husband and I had a couples massage and full use of the spa- beautiful beautiful hydro pool, sauna, steam room and heated loungers. Whilst the prices of the treatments may seem pricey they are worth above and beyond what we paid and were extremely good (if not the best we have ever had). The hotel was spotlessly cleanHowever if you run out of teabags fine housekeeping and don‚Äôt ask at the bar otherwise they will charge you 2 euros a tea bag üôàThe customer service within the hotel was beyond reproach - no request was too big and we were always greeted with familiarity and smiles. Even being offered croissants and drinks at 4am whilst waiting for our taxi on the day of departure was a beautiful touch and much appreciated. Overall small things that didn‚Äôt quite get a 5* however if I could give a 4.75 then I would be! Highly recommend Hotel 1926 and will be suggesting to friends and family to book here in the future as well as booking to return in the future for ourselves",

      "text": "I absolutely enjoyed my stay at this gorgeous hotel. The hotel is very clean, very well located, great facilities and the highlight was the stuff. There are very very polite, friendly and helpful. I loved the fact that the hotel is a green hotel and they care very much about the environment. You will find organic bathroom amenities and other little stuff to make your stay comfortable. The breakfast was amazing, wide selection of choices, fresh and deliciously made. Their beach club is something you definitely need to visit. That one the selling point for me, while booking my stay. The location is right in the heart of Sliema, you have a Point shopping mall just few steps away and a lot of other shops, supermarkets and restaurants around. The room walls were a bit thin so you might hear your neighbours late arrival but it did not make my stay less comfortable. My stay highly exceeded my expectations. Definitely will stay again while visiting Malta. Thank you 1926 hotel for making my stay very comfortable.",

      "title": "Good location and beach club",
      "text": "Hotel 1926 offers a great location far enough away from the hustle of the busy streets but remains close enough for easy access by a few minutes walk. The beach club was the highlight for our stay with amazing views and great food at the restaurant there. We had a free room upgrade so I can‚Äôt speak on price for what you get, but the room was clean and simple, not a bad thing. Also the rooms come with universal plugs which is a big positive which we didn‚Äôt know of!Unfortunately the water pressure in our room was terrible at all times of the day as well as the temperature not maintaining. The elevator. There were 2 however, they were horrendously slow and often missed your floor even though it was requested. This made it frustrating, especially if you‚Äôre on a higher floor. We often found ourselves taking the stairs after waiting 3-4 minutes. The concierge had great recommendations for food, it would have been nice if they offered to make a reservation when they make these suggestions. Other times, it was very hit and miss with who was working at reception as to if your request was met or not. Our checkout was a nightmare as we left our bags with them and were told we could shower in the spa when leaving and they would hold our bags until needed. When this time came, it took 30 minutes for them to retrieve our bags and multiple requests asking where they were and what was taking so long. Finally, I think to say this is a spa hotel is a stretch unfortunately... the massages were overpriced for what they were, I‚Äôve had better from the cheap Thai massage shops at a third of the price. The spa facilities themselves were very underwhelming with a small ‚Äúmassage pool‚Äù, sauna and non functioning steam room.Overall, we enjoyed our stay but I believe this was because we utilised the beach club which was great and often spent our days out so for location and the beach club, amazing. Otherwise, not greatly impressed.",

      "title": "Really disappointed with the pool access ",
      "text": "I stayed at the 1926 hotel for a week with my friend on a girlie trip. We booked the hotel as we like to lounge and sunbathe by the pool all day before exploring different places in the evening. I messaged the beach club before we booked checking that hotel guests had free access to the club and they assured me they did. When we arrived to check in the process was really easy and the hotel staff were polite, kind and friendly. We had been upgraded to a bigger room which was laid out lovely. It was modern with everything we needed. The issues comes with the access to the beach club. We were told on check in that we could either use the pool 9.30am-1 .30 or 2-6.30pm the reason it was these times was so the beds could be sanitised. We were really unhappy with not having access to the pool for the whole day, so on the first day they gave us a full day wrist band. At no point were the beds sanitised or wiped and it was clear that alot of people were paying to use the facilities, which seemed so annoying. That night I spoke to the manager who said that it wasnt to sanitise the beds but because people were reserving beds and not using them that they had set times. I explained that nowhere did it state this before we booked the hotel and he just shrugged.He agreed that we could use the pool all day the following day but not over the weekend as they were really busy. He assured me noone other than hotel guests were allowed to pay to use the pool at this time due to the restrictions. This simply wasn't true. We were asked to vacate our sunbeds at 1.30pm on one of the days, but told we could still use the pool (just not a sunbed) which was really embarassing, moving out stuff to the side of the pool, so we sat in the pool and watched while noone else despite them being the same colour wristbands as us were asked to move. We spoke to the manager AGAIN who gave us day passes for the final 2 days of our stay. I guess for some this isn't an issue, but for us we chose this hotel as it looked like the best place we could sunbathe, relax and enjoy the sea view.The view from the pool and the pool itsself was GORGEOUS and I completely understand the concept of what the hotel is trying to create with the beach club. However, in this circumstance, hotel guests should come first and unfortunately this wasn't and certainly didn't feel the case.",

      "title": "Great room, very modern and clean. Good location if this is your first time in Malta",
      "text": "Great room, although I can‚Äôt tell the difference between the standard and the superior rooms. I booked superior but from the floor plan I was in the smallest room. Very clean and modern (big plus). There‚Äôs a small fridge in the room. Slippers and robes supplied. Hotel situated in a great location, close to Valletta and the ferry. Not in St Julians which turned out to be the correct decision as it was quieter in Sliema. Spar and food stores close by. A nice touch was the little bag of dried flowers for me to take home. Nice memorable gift. You enter your room with a pin code so there‚Äôs no risk of forgetting your swipe card. Also, the wifi password could‚Äôve been printed on the room number card as opposed to handwritten on a sticky (while there‚Äôs nothing wrong with that I feel sorry for the receptionist who has to write this down dozens of times everyday). I gave it four stars because I was initially lead to booking with this hotel because of the infinity pool shown on the booking.com website. Upon arrival I was told that the pool is closed for the season! Very disappointed. I feel that it should be mentioned more prominently regarding the operational dates. But their spa, sauna and steam room made up for that (almost). They were definitely fantastic. There was also construction drilling and hammering noise throughout the day - they say it‚Äôs the building next door but it sounds like it‚Äôs the next wall. The spa itself opens at 8 but the staff said 10 (which was the massage service part, so if you wanted to use just the spa you don‚Äôt need to wait until 10). Finally, a lot of hotels in Malta provide free breakfast and I feel that it should be included given the price. Even if it‚Äôs just the simple options and if you want something fancier you can order extra. Will stay again (when the outdoor pool is open).",

      "title": "Nice hotel with excellent location",
      "text": "Our 7 nights stay with friends at 1926 hotel was very good overall. The hotel is located near the beach boulevard and in my opinion Sliema is the best location to stay while in Malta. Although the area is quite quiet in general, apart some noise from the street on weekend, the hotel could improve soundproofing inside the hotel. When closing the hotel room door (room 611) we could see light coming from the corridor on the edge of the door. Also all the noises from the corridor could be heard very clearly in the room.1926 hotel is very clean and the rooms and public areas are comfortable. Mattress was too stiff for our liking but that is a matter of an opinion. The hair dryer in the room is totally useless, bring your own if you need to dry your hair! Beach Club, located maybe 200 meters from the hotel, was very nice with comfortable sun loungers, big umbrellas, beautiful pool and corgeous sea views. It was the beginning of the season so the services were some what limited, but will propably improve over summer. Hotel also has a spa with a swimming pool and saunas but we didn¬¥t use these facilities. I did see them when visiting the Spa for manicure (which I can totally recommend!) and the spa area also looks very nice.Service on the front desk could be better. Many times there was 4 or 5 persons on the desk but on some occasions none of them even greeted us when we entered the hotel. Service on the breakfast however was very good!Breakfast was ample and delicious. They even served freshly squeezed orange juice and Prosecco. Some problems with the coffee makers but we got our coffee every morning so not a huge problem. Breakfast staff was great! If you want to enjoy your breakfast in peace do go early. It gets busy at 9 AM.For transportation we recommend to use Franklin Garage. Professional and polite drivers, clean cars, easy to reach via Whatsapp, gets you where you want to go on time and with reasonable price.",

      "text": "Amazing location and lovely rooms. We stayed here for 7 nights and thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the hotel. The rooms were of high standard with comfortable beds and air con was fully working and kept the room cool. We particularly enjoyed the beach club and pool area which is about one minute walk from the hotel which was not a problem for us.  I highly recommend trying out the beach club restaurant for their sushi, it was delicious! The breakfast had many options to suit all tastebuds including full English options and continental breakfast. (Photos attached) The staff from housekeeping to restaurant and reception teams were all so friendly and helpful. The location is great and central, it is nearby several different bars and restaurants. We also had a couples massage at the spa and used the indoor pool. It was so relaxing! I highly recommend staying here if visiting Malta!",

No key card for opening the doors was a plus. The breakfast was not really impressive, but there  are multiple cafes in a walking distance so we decided to have breakfasts outside the hotel. The  indoor Spa was also nice and relaxing.Just a few things to consider before booking: - I was hoping to get a room with a view, but  unfortunately, the hotel itself is not by the sea, (although the pictures may give such an impression) and  most of the rooms have windows to small alleys, and that was nothing that the staff could do.- In addition,  while booking, I found the infinity pool  really tempting, and we mainly chose the hotel for its nice infinity pool, but later we realized that the pool is closed during winter season because of the unpredictable weather.- The hotel doesnt have its own parking space, but we didnt find it difficult to find parking spots  closeby,  later in the evenings during holidays.But all in all, it was a nice stay, and I would recommend the hotel.",

      "text": "We booked 7 nights in a superior room with 1926 hotel and we are very happy with the choice. We got a discount for the junior suite since the 2nd night, thanks to the manager Alex, and the room was totally great! Bed, pillows and bedsheats are so comfortable, big balcony,very quiet, the hotel is very close to the sea. We asked some extra salad for breakfast and the manager Dimitri arranged that we receive salads at the table every day. Staff is friendly and always ready to help. You can still have breakfast until 12PM, even though it finishes at 11AM. The beach club and infinity pool is probably the best in Malta. You have to make sure you book it one day in advance. They have great food at the pool and in tge hotel also and are very flexible on your needs. Covid measures are beinv respected inside the hotel and at the pool also. Thanks to managers Alex and Dimitri for the care they took to make our staying great!",

Be aware the safe is NOT big enough to store a 15‚Äù laptop.  Cause of the COVID-19 reservation was needed at the beach club, which is clean and disinfected on a daily basis.   Spa treatments are great but expensive.  Breakfast was median for a 4* star hotel and your temperature was measured on a daily basis due to the current situation.  There are 2 guest elevators, which took about 5‚Äô to 10 minutes to get one.Overall very nice hotel.",
